This is the implementation of Apriori Algorithm in python. Apriori algorithm refers to an algorithm that is used in mining frequent products sets and relevant association rules.
Assumptions made :
Before running either change the name of yor csv file to check.csv or change "check.csv" in read_csv function to your filename.
The format of your csv file should be the same as demonstrated in the demo csv file attached.
The code outputs the final frequent subsets and takes minimum support as input from user.
The check.csv file was used to run the algorithm on demo data.
